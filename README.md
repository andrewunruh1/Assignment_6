# Assignment 6 - Pythonic Monopoly

For this assignmentI created two notebooks to analyze the real estate market in Toronto from 2001 to 2016.  They are both saved within the starter code folder.  

## Rental Analysis

The first notebook is the rental analysis where the census data for Toronto was loaded in. 

### 1
The first thing that I looked at was the different types of houses that are available and the total amount of each for each census year. 
### 2
The next section takes a look at the cost to live in Toronto.  I looked at the average monthly shelter costs for each census year, comparing the cost to rent vs own and how that has changed over 15 years.  I also found the average value of a house over that same time span to allow potential buyers to see how the value of rental homes has changed over the years and can compare that to the rental costs.
### 3
The third section digs into the differences in value based on the neighbourhood that the houses are in.  The first chart in this section looks at the average value of a house that is in each neighbourhood, and the second chart looks into the amount of different stlyes of homes that are in each neighbourhood.  
### 4
The fourth section I filtered the data to show just the 10 most expensive neighbourhoods and showed the price data for each one.  
### 5
In the last section of this notebook I created a map of Toronto, highlighting each of the neighbourhoods in the city.  Hovering over each plotted neighbourhood will show the value of the homes there.  

## Dashboard

The second notebook is the dashboard.  This is where I created a dashboard to group all of the charted information that was done in the rental analysis into one location so clients can easily find what they are looking for.
